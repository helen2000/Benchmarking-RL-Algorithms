| Episodes         | How many episodes to log a detailed report for (ie. output the rest of the things specified below). <br/> <br/> You can pass in either an Integer or List of Integers for this to work. <br/> <br/>Integer: Takes the number, adds one and converts it to a range over the max episodes. <br/> For example: (max_episodes = 1_000, episodes = 5) will save Episodes [0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 999] <br/> <br/>List: Just use that list of integers, capped at the max number of episodes.<br/> For example: (max_episodes = 1_000, episodes = [0, 320, 460, 1625] will save Episodes [0, 320, 460, 999] | Integer, List[Int] | Can't be less than or equal to 0. <br/> <br/>Cumulative and average rewards are collected at the end of each episode, regardless of this number. This means that these will be saved according to the config options below **regardless** of which episodes you choose to record. <br/> <br/>This will record the actions, rewards, state and a video of the agent for each timestep for this episode. |

## Agents (Hyper-parameters)

Settings that are specific to each agent (i.e. hyper-parameters).

Most of these are self-explanatory to the algorithms being used. However, there are some that are unclear. These are detailed below:

- Invert_Done: Can be used for any algorithm - This specifies whether to invert the done flag between 1 and 0 in the replay buffer. 

_NOTE: The config.yml is included in the .gitignore to stop people from overwriting other people's settings. If you
add a field to the config, please ignore the .gitignore and commit it anyways._
